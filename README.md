# Movie-Ticket-System

Java implementation of a Movie Ticket System (OOP project for CS101)

A console-based movie ticket booking system built in Java.  
This project focuses on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles including encapsulation, constructors, composition, aggregation, and method overriding.  

## Features
- Manage movie listings  
- Schedule screenings  
- Assign seats in auditoriums  
- Sell tickets to customers  
- Track revenue from sales  

##  Technologies & Concepts
- **Language:** Java  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Key Concepts Practiced:**  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Constructors  
  - Composition & Aggregation  
  - Method overriding  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **MovieTicketSystem.java** â€“ Main entry point (generates mockup movies, auditoriums, tickets, and screenings).  
- **Movie.java** â€“ Represents a movie with title, duration, etc.  
- **Auditorium.java** â€“ Manages seating capacity and assignments.  
- **Screening.java** â€“ Handles scheduling and seat allocation.  
- **Ticket.java** â€“ Represents purchased tickets.  
- **Seat.java** â€“ Individual seats with availability status.  
- Additional helper classes/methods as needed.
